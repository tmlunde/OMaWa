Open Malaria Warning

Malaria Warning System written as part of the work malaria research group in Bergen, established in 2007 (http://malaria.b.uib.no/malaria-research-group/). 
The two main areas of research are malaria control, and to improve our understanding of possible links between climate change and malaria.

The model is driven by weather data, as well as population densities, cattle densities and landuse. A working example with input data can be found here:
