# OMaWa -- Open Malaria Warning

Malaria Warning system written as part of the work malaria research group in Bergen, established in 2007 (http://malaria.b.uib.no/malaria-research-group/). The system is used to research malaria control, and to improve our understanding of possible links between climate change and malaria.

OMaWa is a R package containing most of the functions described in "A dynamic model of some malaria-transmitting anopheline mosquitoes of the Afrotropical region."

The function simpleMalaria() is a simple example of how the model can be used. This function was used 
to create Figure 1 in A dynamic model of some malaria-transmitting anopheline mosquitoes of the Afrotropical region. part I.

We have also included the functions described in Mordecai, Erin A, Paaijmans, Krijn P, Johnson, Leah R, Balzer, Christian, Ben-Horin, Tal, de Moor, Emily, McNally, Amy, Pawar, Samraat, Ryan, Sadie J, Smith, Thomas C, Lafferty, Kevin D, and Thrall, Peter: Optimal temperature for malaria transmission is dramatically lower than previously predicted., Ecol Lett, October 2012

The package was built under Linux.

The full model is driven by weather data, as well as population densities, cattle densities and landuse. A working example with input data can be found here:
